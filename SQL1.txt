======
Atomicity
Consistency

Durability



Relational properties
===
1. One to One Relationship
2. Many to One Relationship
3. One to Many Relationship
4. Many to Many Relationship


Relational DBs or SQL databases

=======================

MySql
DB2(IBM)
Postgre
Oracle
H2
HSQL
SQLServer etc.,



Here DAta is categorized in to differret tables called as Relations 
Each Relation or Table or Entity inclues set of rows amd columns.
Each column holds attribute of the entity


EXAMPLE
======
Customer=>customerid, customername, customernum

Customer => Entity => Table => Relation
customerid,customername ,m => attributes of entity => columns
values of above attributes are stored as row => tuple => which holds all the details of a entity as a row
Degree of a Table or Relation => number of attributes in a table
cardinality => number of rows/tuples in the table

The above generates all relationships or Associations  like 
one to one
one to many
many to one
many to many


Components of DBMS
=================
Hardware => Dssk and RAM,keyboard,monitor etc,
Software => Mysql or Oracle
Data => Information collected 
Procedures => Rules that help in using DBMS
DB Access Language => Query Language to perform operations like create,read,update and delete



Normalzation== To delete redundant data or duplicate data as to aquire for data interity




SQL(Structured 	Query    LAnguage)

DDL(DATA DEFINITIO LANGUAGE)=======create  or remove and change table in database
====
create
alter
drop
truncate



DML(DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE)====create or remove or change values in table
==========
insert
update
delete



DCL(DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE)=====set privilages for accessing database
==
grant
revoke


TCL(TRABSACTION CONTROL lan)===commit or roll back the database
commit
rollback
savepoint

DQL(DATA QUERY LAN)====retrive the data using select statement
=======
select
